# remote-model-access
Allows you to chat with a llm from a separate device through tailscale on an iphone.
This was made in Xcode, and I dont have an apple developer account so I cant make this an .ipa, unless I find some other way.
Ill put more info and files here soon

# how to use
🔰 Download the zip file in #Releases.

🔰 After unzipping, open it with Xcode.

🔰 Pair your iPhone with Xcode.

🔰 Select your iPhone as a run destination and run it.

🔰 The app should then download to your iPhone.

🔰 In the app, put it in at least the Server Endpoint and API Key.

🔰 Now you should be good, as long as you're connected through wireguard (I used tailscale) or on the same wifi.

## I used LM Studio to host an llm.

# features (this is kind of simple but still)
