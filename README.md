# remote-model-access
Allows you to chat with a llm from a separate device on the same wifi on an iphone or with tailscale, from anywhere.

Ill put more info and files here soon

# how to use
🔰 Download the zip file in RELEASES.

🔰 Install the resulted .ipa file with whatever signer you use (feather, esign, gbox, etc.

🔰 Inside the app, put it in at least the Server Endpoint and API Key.

🔰 Now you should be good, as long as you're connected through wireguard (I used tailscale) or on the same wifi.

## I used LM Studio to host a llm, but you can use ollama or others as long as they give you a working server endpoint and api key.
